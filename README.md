# Temporary dune port of hacl-star-raw

This repository holds a subset of
[hacl-star](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star)
tweaked to build the ocaml bindings with dune.

It is simply intended to provide a version of the package that can be used
with [opam-monorepo](https://ocamllabs/opam-monorepo).

The dune port branches are extracted from the
[dune-universe fork of hacl-star](https://github.com/dune-universe/hacl-star)
to be easily packaged for
[opam-overlays](https://github.com/dune-universe/opam-overlays).

The original dune port was done by @CraigFe. The upstream PR is available
[here](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/pull/426).
